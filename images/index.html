              In many organizations, there is a huge gap or a great divide
              between who we say we are and how we do business, between the
              overarching mission of the church and the activities the church
              promotes. How many of your teams or committees look at the mission
              and vision when planning activities?

              Keep in mind that many of these goals assist one another, and the

              actions you could take to improve your websites conversion rate,
              for example, might also help your business improve customer
              interactions as well.
